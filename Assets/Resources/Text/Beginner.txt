You've just entered Beginner Race mode! How's about I tell you a little about how it works.
In this mode, you will be racing against other racers.
These racers are not the brightest bulbs in the box, so you shouldn't have too much trouble with them.
If you want a bigger challenge though, try out the Advanced Race Mode!
Use the A and D keys to move around the map.
Now get out there!
End.
