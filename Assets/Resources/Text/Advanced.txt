You've just entered Advanced Race mode! How's about I tell you a little about how it works.
In this mode, you will be racing against other racers.
These racers are hardcore though, so watch your back!
If you need a bit of a warm-up, try out the Beginner Race Mode.
Use the A and D keys to move around the map.
Now get out there!
End.
