You've just entered Checkpoint Race mode! How's about I tell you a little about how it works.
In this mode, you will be racing against the clock to reach the finish line.
On the way, you'll find checkpoints that you can use to give yourself some extra time.
If the time runs out, you lose.
Use the A and D keys to move around the map.
Now get out there!
End.
